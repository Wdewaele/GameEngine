Dear user 

use  WSAD for moving the camera
use shift to go down and space bar to go up

you can use the keys UHJK just like WASD to move the Light in x and z
use O and L to move the light up and down


to switch the light diffuse in real time 
key 1 = color.r --
key 2 = color.r ++
key 3 = color.g --
key 4 = color.g ++
key 5 = color.b --
key 6 = color.b ++

Have Fun

# CloudEngine

__What this project is about__
- Making a game engine from scratch with the least possible libraries within a given time of 5 months.
- Implementing everything on our own.
- The objective is to make a fps-puzzle game using only our game engine.

- The project is composed by 3 three people :[Charly Jeaucq](https://github.com/CJeauc), [Saad Raouf](https://github.com/Synyproxy) &       myself. My main contributions, despite the helpful hand I gave to my partners, are creating the entire editor interface (and its           consequences) and implementing the debugging tools.

__Libraries used__
- Bullet
- Assimp
- Irrklang
- OpenGl
- Qt

__Project constraints__
- The editor must work on Windows.
- The engine must support only one rendering API. 
- The engine must use our own mathematics library .
- the engine must use an existing physic library.

__Missing anything ?__
- The project is currently on progress,so some features will come on future updates.

__Project' state__
- we are currently halfway through the time given for the project (deadline is around the 5 june 2019).

__Warning__
- in case you are not willing to install Qt (which is quite heavy), you can always start the prepared build by hitting the shortcut and waiting a couple of seconds.

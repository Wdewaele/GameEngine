# CloudEngine

 ## What this project is about
- Making a game engine from scratch with the least possible libraries within a given time of 5 months.
- Implementing everything on our own.
- The objective is to make a fps-puzzle game using only our game engine.

- The project is composed by 3 three people :[Charly Jeauc](https://github.com/CJeauc), [Saad Raouf](https://github.com/Synyproxy) &       myself. My main contributions, despite the helpful hand I gave to my partners, are creating the entire editor interface (and its           consequences) and implementing the debugging tools.
- The project counts as our end-of-year project for our second year at Isart Digital Montr√©al.

 ## Libraries used
- Bullet
- Assimp
- Irrklang
- OpenGl
- Qt

## Project constraints
- The editor must work on Windows.
- The engine must support only one rendering API. 
- The engine must use our own mathematics library .
- The engine must use an existing physic library.

## Missing anything ?
- The project is currently on progress, so some features will come on future updates.

## Project status
- We are currently halfway through the time given for the project (deadline is around the 5 june 2019).

## Warning
- In case you are not willing to install Qt (which is quite heavy), you can always start the prepared build by hitting the shortcut and waiting a couple of seconds.
